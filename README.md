## Capstone Project Information:

Title of your Capstone Project: Predicting Football Players' Positions Using FIFA 23 Data and Machine Learning

Name of Your Selected Dataset: Data will be scraped from https://sofifa.com/players and this file will be called soccer_players.csv

Description of Your Selected Dataset (data source, number of variables, size of dataset, etc.): 
list them all but mention what we will after literature review (currently around 30 but will need to cut down either through algorithm and data cleaning )
https://sofifa.com/player/212823/gabriel-barbosa-almeida/200023/?attr=career
There are over 17,000 players in the database

## Data Science Objectives

From the models, the data science objectives are to identify how the data will be used to successfully contribute to the business. Given that the cost of a player for a team can be expensive, the business objective would be to help teams determine where to place players on the field and to help with teamsâ€™ investment in the right players. For that reason, the objective of this model is to classify players in the correct positions with an accuracy that exceeds that of the baseline model. 

## Planned Methodology 

	The planned methodologies include scraping data from https://sofifa.com. The problem will be approached using the CRISP-DM methodology. This includes understanding problem statements, understanding the data and preparing correctly for the modeling phase, performing the analysis and modeling, validating the results, presenting the results and visualizations, and lastly, deploying the model. 

## Real-World Impact and Planned Deliverables

The real-world impact for this study is to come up with an algorithm that will contribute to determining the ideal field placement for soccer players to help teams utilize players to their strengths based on where they have been classified. This could be applied to helping soccer teams in professional soccer make the right investment in their players. A secondary area in which this algorithm could contribute to is in sports betting, where those placing bets could see if players are placed in an ideal field position, and use the information to determine whether the placement will benefit or cost the team. 
The planned deliverables include a final technical research paper, presentation, and utilization of Power BI and  Flask app.
